 bulk_insert_buffer_size



MyISAM uses a special tree-like cache to make bulk inserts 
faster for INSERT ... SELECT, INSERT ... VALUES (...), (...), ...,
 and LOAD DATA INFILE when adding data to nonempty tables. 
This variable limits the size of the cache tree in bytes per thread. 
Setting it to 0 disables this optimization. 
The default value is 8MB.
